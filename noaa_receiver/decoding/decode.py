    Static models are not trustworthy here: the dongle's tuning error is
    only approximated by the calibration ppm, transmitters can be off
    their nominal frequency, and Doppler adds a few kHz. So the decode
    centering measures the signal's spectral position instead of
    trusting any of that.

    The search is a signal-width-matched sliding window (mean power per
    window, satellite side of the tuner only, so the +SDR_OFFSET_HZ DC
    spike and the R820T spurs cannot win a naive peak search).

    But a plain window search is fooled by LOCAL transmitters: this
    site has a persistent ~11 kHz carrier around 137.905 MHz (Region-1
    land mobile, ~7.5 kHz below the Meteor LRPT downlink) measuring
    20-40x the noise floor, which captured the measurement live
    (2026-10-10: -47.6 kHz "measured" from that carrier while a real
    LRPT signal would sit near -60 kHz; the demodulator then centered
    empty spectrum). A LEO downlink differs from local junk in exactly
    two measurable ways: it DRIFTS with Doppler (several hundred Hz
    between the first and last thirds of a recording, +/-3.4 kHz over
    a pass at 137.9 MHz) and the wide digital modes fill tens of kHz.
    The winning window's excess-power region is therefore gated:

      - width >= 45% of signal_bw_hz -> a broadband satellite signal
        (low passes drift little, so width must be able to carry them)
      - else centroid drift between the recording's first and last
        thirds >= 300 Hz -> a moving carrier: the satellite
      - otherwise the feature is stationary and narrow: a local
        transmitter -> None, and the caller falls back to the
        tuner-offset rotation (correct whenever the correction is)

    Returns None when nothing passes the gates.

    itself. SatDump wedge-calibrates the channels, builds a false-color

    from its own TLE file - seeded from the receiver's TLE cache by
    _seed_satdump_tles - geo-referenced with the recording's start

    a wrong map), so it is only passed for a known satellite.

    decodes - APT, DSB, LRPT - run through one decoder. Synchronous:
    ~2.5 min for a 12-min pass on the container (the projection solve
