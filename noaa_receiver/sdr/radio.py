"""SDR threads: per-dongle rtl_tcp capture, waterfall FFT, FM demod, WAV recording.

All attached dongles run on the same frequency with the same settings (they
re-tune together via state.current_frequency). A dongle is a REMOTE rtl_tcp
server identified by "host:port" — e.g. a Raspberry Pi running one
rtl-tcp@<serial>.service daemon per dongle (the serving host pins which
physical dongle answers on which port). The receiver owns no USB devices:
it connects out, and dongles are added/removed at runtime from the
dashboard (radio.add_dongle / remove_dongle, persisted in DONGLES_FILE).

Each dongle's capture thread reads the IQ stream from its socket and
retunes by sending rtl_tcp frequency commands — the stream keeps flowing
while the tuner re-locks, so a frequency switch takes milliseconds and
does not restart anything, gap the audio, or split the recording. The
configured primary dongle feeds the live audio stream and records WAVs
during passes. Every dongle gets its own waterfall buffer and signal
strength, so receive quality can be compared on the dashboard.
