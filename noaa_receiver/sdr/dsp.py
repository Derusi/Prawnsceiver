"""DSP chain: offset rotation, low-pass filtering, Doppler NCO, FM discrimination.

Every stage carries its state in a per-capture-thread dict (new_state()) so
that block-wise processing is identical to processing the whole stream: FIR
tails, the decimation phase, the rotator counter and the NCO phase all
survive block boundaries. Two dongles demodulate concurrently, so nothing
stream-specific may live in a module global — that includes the Doppler
NCO's cached ramp, which therefore sits in the state dict too.

    scheduler steps doppler_hz every few seconds; a frequency change in an
    NCO must not jump the phase, so the phase (st["nco_phase"]) accumulates
    across blocks AND across Doppler updates. (An absolute-sample-count
    phase like -2*pi*d*k/fs jumps by an arbitrary angle at every update:
    each jump is a full-scale click in the demodulated audio.)

    The per-block rotation is exp(i*phase) * ramp, with ramp[j] =
    exp(i*dphase*j) for j < block length. The ramp only depends on the
    Doppler value and is rebuilt when it changes (every few seconds), so
    no per-sample exp() runs in the capture loop — and unlike a
    fs/gcd-period LUT it is tiny (block length, not up to fs samples) and
    needs no periodicity argument.

    doppler_hz == 0 keeps applying the constant phasor exp(i*phase): going
    from a rotation to "multiply by 1" is itself a phase jump. (A Doppler
    track crossing 0 Hz at closest approach clicked by up to 27 % of full
    scale before this was handled.) The phase is per stream, so the ramp
