"""Integration test: the real sdr_capture_thread against a fake rtl_tcp server.

Drives the recording state machine (pass start/end, same-frequency pass
switch, band switch mid-pass, per-dongle override, WAV open failure,
reconnect after a dropped stream) and checks the rtl_tcp commands and WAV
files it produces. The fake server speaks the real rtl_tcp protocol: a
12-byte RTL0 handshake followed by an endless IQ stream, recording the
5-byte control commands it receives.

Run: python3 -u tests/test_radio.py (needs numpy; ~20 s; uses TCP port 1299)
