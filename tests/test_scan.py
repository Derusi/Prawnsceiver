"""Tests for noaa_receiver.scan: peak/floor measurement, width fit, scan sweep.

Run: python3 tests/test_scan.py (needs numpy). Asserts:

- _measure finds the true peak bin and ratio, ignoring the DC-spike
  window at +SDR_OFFSET_HZ (a spike there must never win the peak search)
- _signal_width_hz measures a synthetic hump's occupied width and
  refuses to measure noise
- fit_bw_hz maps width -> demod cutoff (APT-like signal -> ~22 kHz) and
  clamps to the 1-120 kHz range
- the scan thread end-to-end against a fake dongle entry whose feeder
  is TUNE-AWARE (signals sit at absolute frequencies and land at 0 Hz
  once the scan re-centers on them; spurs follow the tune):
  nothing found (override restored), found (parked on the re-centered
  peak, bandwidth fitted), stop request (parked at the current
  frequency), saturating impulse noise ignored, carrier found through
  impulse noise, and a tune-relative spur (the live phantom-finder
  bug class) rejected by the re-center confirm
